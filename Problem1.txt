Q2

Which of the following attribute modifiers allows subclasses to have access to the attribute itself?

a) private
b) public
c) protected

Answer: c

a is incorrect since private restricts access to any class BUT the class itself
b (public) does allow subclasses to access the attribute, however so can every other class whether they extend it or not
c is the right answer, more specific to subclasses than b.
